# FFXII The Zodiac Age Bazaar Tool

This tool helps searching for items and 'recipes' that are available in the Bazaar. This repo contains the parsed data, a Python tool that extracts the data from the spreadsheet (created by copy-pasting the table into Excel), and the code of the app itself.

All the information was retrieved from the [Final Fantasy Wiki](<http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Bazaar_(Final_Fantasy_XII)>).
